        <p class="about">I've been drawing 20+ years, all started with anime since I was young. From there it became a passion that I've been practicing non-stop. With the advances in technology now it became about digital art. Digital programs open up a new world to explore and with the creation of NFT's it becomes a good play for artist to be able to show and sell their art. It's a new venture that will just keep growing and I'm exited to explore and learn more. </p>
